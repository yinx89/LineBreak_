# LineBreak_
The program works with two parameters: a text in Spanish and an integer. 

You must enter both to get the text is divided as many as many lines as the integer that we have indicated. 

In addition, each line will show up to as many characters as we have indicated through the whole number, 
separating into syllables if required to complete the sentences optimally. 

You can check that the program performs a series of checks to ensure that the appropriate values are 
established for a correct LineBreak. 

This is a program I did to become part of the Microsoft Student Partner Program.
